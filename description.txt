String is premitive datatype 
array , objects are non premitive data type 

let x = "Ruhul Amin" -> this is literal syntax  -> string 
let y = new String("ruhul amin") -> this is not literal syntax -> object 

if(x == y )  // return true bcz it only check the value 
if(x === y ) // return false bcz it both check value & data type  
here x = string variable 
y = object 

you cannot compare tow objects 

example : 
let x = new String("ruhul");
let y = new String("ruhul");
if(x == y) // it returns false 
// bcz object cannot be compared though the values are same ! 

object's property can also be a function that time it is called method ! 

array is a special type of object 

array element can be function also 
 
const person = []
person["firstName"] = "ruhulamin"
person["lastName"] = "Amin"

console.log(person) // it will consider as object not array 
// though it is declered as an array 

let array = new array(40) // is a bad syntax !

typeof , instanseof  => these are operator ! 

array is an instanceof object 
object is not an instanceof array
