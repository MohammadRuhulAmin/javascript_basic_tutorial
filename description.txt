String is premitive datatype 
array , objects are non premitive data type 

let x = "Ruhul Amin" -> this is literal syntax  -> string 
let y = new String("ruhul amin") -> this is not literal syntax -> object 

if(x == y )  // return true bcz it only check the value 
if(x === y ) // return false bcz it both check value & data type  
here x = string variable 
y = object 

you cannot compare tow objects 

example : 
let x = new String("ruhul");
let y = new String("ruhul");
if(x == y) // it returns false 
// bcz object cannot be compared though the values are same ! 

object's property can also be a function that time it is called method !
